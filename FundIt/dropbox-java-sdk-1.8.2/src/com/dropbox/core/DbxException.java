     * The server said that something went wrong on its end (HTTP 500 error code).
     * This indicates bug on the Dropbox server, but there are multiple potential causes.
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>Sometimes it's just a bug and there's nothing you can
     *     do about it until its fixed.  Report it on the Dropbox API forums.
     *     </li>
     * <li>Sometimes you're actually making an invalid request, but for some reason
     *     the server's validation logic isn't catching the problem and it's
     *     causing the server to error-out somewhere down the line.  You may be able to
     *     fix your request and get things working.  This is still a bug on Dropbox's end,
     *     so you should still report it on the Dropbox API forums.</li>
     * <li>Sometimes the error is intermittent.  It may only happen once every few
     *     requests, in which case you can temporarily work around the issue by
     *     retrying the request.  Again, this still counts as a bug so report it on
     *     the forums.</li>
     * <li>Sometimes the error is temporary.  For example, Dropbox might be experiencing
     *     a temporary network or hardware issue.  If you wait a few minutes, the error
     *     might stop happening.  You might want to check the forums to see if other
     *     people are seeing the same thing.</li>
