So far it has loaded what I want into the cells just not at the right positions. At this point it's really just a formatting
issue. There are some things that don't show up but those shouldn't be that much of a problem to fix. Formatting Still needs
work but all the data is showing up properly.

Read a bit of the Jexcel tutorial, just figuring things out now. Figured out how to make a workbook. Figured out how to
make a sheet for said workbook. Lots of formatting. Ran into problems with database and Workbook. Problem Solved. Trying
to figure out how to load all the individual donor's info in the database onto the excel sheet. Ran into problems. Doesn't
properly load everything into the cells, although it does get the correct positions, mostly.

I installed the Jexcel api onto the project (I thought I had already installed it, guess not). As I was about to start on
the writing to excel part I need to first figure out how I'm gonna lay this out. I'm wondering if I should make it where
he can chose what he want's on the info or to maybe have it like that in a later version and instead just have him only
have what I created.

Found a good tutorial covering how to use Jexcelapi, currently reading through it.

Figured out how to make it not out of bounds but I don't understand why this works and why the old way didn't. Basically
what I did is instead of using the removeAllItems function I decided to just remove the preloaded items out individually.
This made the program work and not give me errors for that part. But then I ran into another problem which is now that
the jComboBox2 works (The one that has the DonorID's) it's not giving me all the Donations that I want to load from an
individual into a Donation ComboBox that I made. My idea was that when the donation combobox is set to a donation the
donation info would be pulled from the database into the Textfields that I put up. For some reason it's not loading up
all the donations for each individual and it's not loading the donationID's that are associated with them.

Working on the updates still. I'm still gettng an error in the ItemStateChanged part of the jComboBox1, it's telling me
the jComboBox2 is out of bounds but I don't understand how since I loaded it with items before the frame even appears. 
After Searching the internet I found that if I get an error message that the combobox is out of bounds then that means 
that the jcombobox is returning -1 which is NULL.
