Figured out how to make it not out of bounds but I don't understand why this works and why the old way didn't. Basically
what I did is instead of using the removeAllItems function I decided to just remove the preloaded items out individually.
This made the program work and not give me errors for that part. But then I ran into another problem which is now that
the jComboBox2 works (The one that has the DonorID's) it's not giving me all the Donations that I want to load from an
individual into a Donation ComboBox that I made. My idea was that when the donation combobox is set to a donation the
donation info would be pulled from the database into the Textfields that I put up. For some reason it's not loading up
all the donations for each individual and it's not loading the donationID's that are associated with them.

Working on the updates still. I'm still gettng an error in the ItemStateChanged part of the jComboBox1, it's telling me
the jComboBox2 is out of bounds but I don't understand how since I loaded it with items before the frame even appears. 
After Searching the internet I found that if I get an error message that the combobox is out of bounds then that means 
that the jcombobox is returning -1 which is NULL.
